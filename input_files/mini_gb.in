Minimizing the system, 1000 steps of
steepest descent and 9000 of conjugated gradient
&cntrl
imin=1,		! Minimize the initial structure
ntx=1,		! Read input coordinates
irest=0,	! Run as a new simulation
ntpr=50,	! Print to mdout every ntpr steps
ntf=1,		! Complete force evaluation
ntb=0,		! No periodic boundary is applied
cut=9999.0,	! Infinite cut-off in Angstroms
nsnb=5,		! Update of pair list frequency
maxcyc=10000,	! Maximum minimization cycles
ncyc=1000,	! Steepest descent algorithm for the first ncyc cycles, then switches the conjugate gradient algorithm for maxcyc-ncyc cycles
ntmin=1,	! Method of minimization: steepest descent method is used then conjugate gradient is switched on
ioutfm=1,	! Write trajectory file in NetCDF format
igb=1,		! Standard pairwise generalized Born implicit solvation using the default radii set up by LeaP
extdiel=37.5,   ! External dielectric constant (solvent:ACN)
